# A High-Quality Workflow for Multi-Resolution Scientific Data Reduction and Visualization

While preparing the artifacts, we executed them on a single node from the Chameleon Cloud, equipped with two Intel Xeon Gold 6242 CPUs and 192 GB of memory (specifically, ```compute_skylake``` configuration). We recommend that reviewers also use the Chameleon Cloud for artifact evaluation.
